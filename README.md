# ACLED Data Analysis: Mapping Event Types by Region and Year

This repository contains the Python script and replication files for the **ACLED Data Analysis** project. The project visualizes conflict event data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), focusing on event types, their geographic distribution, and fatalities for a selected year and region.

---

## Project Overview

The script generates regional maps that visualize event types, scaling the event points by the number of fatalities. Each regionâ€™s map highlights countries involved in conflicts and plots events geographically, categorized by event type. The visualizations provide insights into conflict patterns and severity within each region.

## Repository Structure

- **Data Folder**:
  - Contains the ACLED dataset (`2021-12-14-2024-12-17.csv`).
- **Scripts Folder**:
  - Contains the Python script for mapping and analysis.
- **Results Folder**:
  - Contains the output maps for each region, saved as `.png` files.

## Key Features of the Analysis

- **Dynamic Year and Region Selection**:
  - The script filters events for a specific year (e.g., 2024).
  - It generates a separate map for each unique region.

- **Interactive Mapping**:
  - Plots events by geographic coordinates.
  - Differentiates event types using color-coded scatter points.
  - Scales scatter point size by the number of fatalities.

- **Region and Country Visualization**:
  - Highlights only the countries in the region on the map.
  - Annotates country names at their centroids for clarity.

- **Custom Legends**:
  - Includes a legend to scale fatalities, aiding interpretation of event severity.

## Generated Maps

For each region, the output map shows:
1. **Geographic Distribution**:
   - Countries involved in the region, plotted with light gray and black edges.
2. **Conflict Events**:
   - Scatter points for events, categorized by event type and scaled by fatalities.
3. **Annotations**:
   - Country names displayed at their centroids for quick identification.

Each map is saved in the `Results` folder with filenames following the format:
```
event_types_<region_name>_fatalities_scale_<year>.png
```

Example:
```
event_types_africa_fatalities_scale_2024.png
```

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data handling and preprocessing.
  - `matplotlib`: For visualization and plotting.
  - `geopandas`: For geographic shapefile manipulation and mapping.

## How to Run the Script

1. **Set Up Input Files**:
   - Place the ACLED dataset (`2021-12-14-2024-12-17.csv`) in the specified folder.
   - Ensure all necessary Python libraries are installed.

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Modify `selected_year` in the script to set the year of interest.
   - Execute the script to generate maps for all regions in the dataset.

3. **View and Save Output**:
   - Output maps are saved in the `Results` folder.
   - Maps are displayed after generation for review.
